We scaled the Neuro-symbolic learning algorithms to provide satisfaction for long horizon temporal specifications. Please visit our open source toolbox [STL_dropout](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STL_dropout) for this purpose. This was achieved by involving [stochastic depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382) (firstly proposed for ResNet) in a Neuro-symbolic learning algorithm when the symbolic part is defined over a long horizon.
