In this paper, we generated the first deterministic formal verification framework for Signal Temporal logics in collaboration with research scientists of Toyota Research Institute North of America (TRINA) and we named it STLVerNN. This methodology addresses the problem of software verification and verifies a program satisfies a general temporal task when it starts from an unknown but bounded initial state.
