In this paper, we extended one of the most popular recent techniques for robustness analysis of neural networks ( LipSDP ) that provides guarantees on its Lipstchitz constant. We enhanced this technique and provided tight and computationally efficient guarantees for local Lipschitz constants. We called this contribution Local-LipSDP. This technique significantly enhances the accuracy and scalability of robustness analysis for neural networks. We successfully applied this technique to the MNIST dataset to efficiently estimate the maximum level of uncertainty the model can tolerate on an image while still maintaining accurate classification.
