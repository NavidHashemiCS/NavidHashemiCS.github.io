In this paper, we scaled the Neuro-symbolic learning algorithms to provide satisfaction for long horizon temporal specifications. We called this training algorithm STL_dropout. This was achieved by involving stochastic depth (firstly proposed for ResNet) in a Neuro-symbolic learning algorithm when the symbolic part is defined over a long horizon.
