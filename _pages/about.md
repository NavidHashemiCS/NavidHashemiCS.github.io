![Neurosymbolic AI introduction](/images/Neurosymbolic AI.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"}

I am a last year PhD student at the Engineering school of the University of Southern California (USC-Viterbi) majoring in Computer Science.

My research area lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Temporal Logics, with applications in Formal Verification and Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning.

# Selected Experience

## Open Source Contribution
I generated the first deterministic formal verification framework for Signal Temporal logics in collaboration with research scientists of Toyota Research Institute North of America (TRINA) [STLVerNN](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STL_dropout) that verifies general Temporal specifications for Learning enabled autonomous systems.

I scaled the process of Neural feedback policy learning for agents to satisfy Signal Temporal Logics specification [STL_dropout](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STL_dropout). This was achieved by combination of stochastic depth (firstly proposed for ResNet) via Neurosymbolic MBRL.
