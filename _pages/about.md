I am a last year PhD student at the Engineering school of the University of Southern California (USC-Viterbi) majoring in Computer Science.

My research area is in the intersection of Artificial Inteligence and Temporal Logics with application on Formal Verification and Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning.
