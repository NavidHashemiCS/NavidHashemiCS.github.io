I am a last year PhD student at the Engineering school of the University of Southern California (USC-Viterbi) majoring in Computer Science.

My research area lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Temporal Logics, with applications in Formal Verification and Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning.
