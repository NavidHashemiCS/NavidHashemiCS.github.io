![Neurosymbolic AI introduction](/images/Neurosymbolic AI.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"}

I am a last year PhD student at the Engineering school of the University of Southern California (USC-Viterbi) majoring in Computer Science.

My research area lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Temporal Logics, with applications in Formal Verification and Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning.

# Selected Experience

## Open Source Contribution
I generated the first deterministic formal verification framework for Signal Temporal logics in collaboration with research scientists of Toyota Research Institute North of America (TRINA) [STLVerNN](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STLVerNN) that verifies general Temporal specifications for Learning enabled autonomous systems.

I scaled the process of Neural Feedback Policy Learning for agents to satisfy Signal Temporal Logics specification [STL_dropout](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STL_dropout). This was achieved by combination of stochastic depth (firstly proposed for ResNet) via Neurosymbolic MBRL.

## Research Outcomes
I have published 4 jouranal papers and 15 conference papers focusing on Neurosymbolic Learning and Verification, CPS and Control Theory in reputable IEEE and ACM journals and conferences. Feel free to see my [publication entry](https://navidhashemicodes.github.io/publications/)   


## Upcomming News
1- My paper :  LB4TL: Smooth Semantics for Temporal Logic for Scalable Training of Neural Feedback Controllers.<br> has been accepted in ADHS conference and I will present it in Colorado University in July.<br>
2- My paper :  Scaling Learning based Policy Optimization for Temporal Tasks via Dropout<br> has been submitted to ACM Tranactions of Cyber Physical Systems<br>
3- Another paper of mine has been accepted in the first round of review for IEEE Transaction on Parallel Distributed systems and it will also hopefuly pass the second round.<br>
